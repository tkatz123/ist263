            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>Hi, I’m Tyler Katz</p>

            <p>
                I’m a current senior at Syracuse University completing a B.S. in Applied Data Analytics, with plans to begin a M.S. in Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence in Fall 2026. I’m passionate about applying data science, machine learning, and AI to solve real-world problems in ways that are both impactful and ethical.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the past eight months, I’ve worked as an undergraduate research assistant in data analytics, gaining hands-on experience with data preprocessing, statistical modeling, and translating technical insights for non-technical audiences. This role has strengthened my foundation and deepened my commitment to building solutions that prioritize usability and human impact.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also currently serve as Engineering Lead for Cuse AI, a first-of-its-kind, student-run organization dedicated to educating students across disciplines on emerging AI technologies. In this role, I guide project teams from scoping to deployment—providing technical direction, architecture and tooling recommendations, code reviews, and hands-on support for both technical and non-technical members.

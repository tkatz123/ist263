        <h1>Tyler Katz Biography</h1>

        <p>
            Hi, I'm Tyler Katz, I am a senior studying Applied Data Analytics in the iSchool. I enjoy learning about <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> within courses for my major. I plan to pursue a M.S. in Human Centered Artificial Intelligence at the iSchool after graduation. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm skilled in <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>R</strong>, and <strong>SQL</strong> coding languages. This summer I worked on several personal projects, the one I'm most proud of is my fake news detection project which leverages machine learning models including logistic regression and random forest classification to predict if articles where misinformation with 95% accuracy.

            My goal taking IST 263 is to gain a foundational understanding of front-end developement to round out my existing set of coding skills.

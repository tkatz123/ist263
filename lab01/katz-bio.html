        Hi, I'm Tyler Katz, I am a senior studying Applied Data Analytics in the iSchool. I enjoy learning about machine learning and artificial intelligence within courses for my major. I plan to pursue a M.S. in Human Centered Artificial Intelligence at the iSchool after graduation. 

        I'm skilled in Python, R, and SQL coding languages. This summer I worked on several personal projects, the one I'm most proud of is my fake news detection project which leverages machine learning models including logistic regression and random forest classification to predict if articles where misinformation with 95% accuracy.

        Outside of school and work, I enjoy going on long runs, spending time outdoors, going to the gym, and spending time with my family. When I'm not at school I live in New Jersey with my family. I have 2 brothers and 2 sisters but only one of my brothers still lives at home with me.

        My goal taking IST 263 is to gain a foundational understanding of front-end developement to round out my existing set of coding skills.
